Job History:

2019-Present: TechMahindra 
* Continued work that I was doing at Rackspace.

* Data Center Support - Internal DNS support APIs: (2018-present)
  * Testing based on the [behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) BDD tool for Python.
  * Fixed fragile and aged-out tests for existing/legacy version 1 of the DNS API.
  * Created testing for version 2 of the DNS API:
      * v2 was a completely new and different API and required all new tests and testing architecture.
      * This is where mentoring offshore SDETs started.
      * End-to-end load testing and system latency testing, from API call to when data was available via the `bind` DNS server.
* Internal Tooling for Sales: (2017-2018)
  * Did UI testing in Python and Selenium using OpenCAFE.
  * Helped team transition tests to BDD-testing in Python using `behave`.
* Run Book Automation Project: (2016-2017)
  * Worked for a year coordinating offshore teams doing remote testing for new PCI compliant system.
  * Worked on back-end API testing and co-contributed to test-suite tooling that was shared with other internal product testing efforts.

2005-2016: Seagate:  (TCGSWG -> Trusted Computing Group's Storage Working Group)

  resolution and automated injection of audience-relevent markup.
  Produced both internal and external product documentation for over a dozen audiences
  from just one set of sources and meta-data.
* Developed host-side testing infrastructure for on-drive TCGSWG Security protocols.
  Testing infrastructure was able to tweak, modify, and examine every level and
  aspect of the security protocol, handled power-cycling, as well as Firmware Downloads.
